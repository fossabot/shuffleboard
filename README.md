# Shuffleboard

Meet Shuffleboard. Shuffleboard likes to break your async code that forgot to
account for AJAX requests not necessarily returning in the order they were sent
out, or at the very least provide some realism to your dev environment, where
net requests are probably handled instantly and defensive asynchronous
programming can be easy to slack off on (or forget entirely).
